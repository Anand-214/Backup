2.l={x:x*x for x in l if x%2==0}
 what is the value of l=?
3.l=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
pop(1)
what is the value of l=?
4.l=[1,2,3,4,5,6]
pop(-1)
what is the value of L=?
5.for i in range(0,5):
       for j in range(0,5):
             if i==j:
                 continue
              else:
                 print(j)

True or False questions =>

1. Key elements in dictionary can be of any type (like list, tuple, string, dictionary, numeric): FALSE  - Key elements can be int, string, float,boolean (because they are immutable) (but it can't be list or dictionary)
2. Mutable objects can be modified. : True
3. Map function returns a List. : TRUE (if we type cast it like list(map(int,list1)) it will return a list.
4. will lambda function return a function object  : TRUE
5. In python Overriding is not possible. :FALSE
6. Class variable can be modified by instance of the class.  : FALSE
7. __init__() function is a constructor. :TRUE
8. "self" is an instance of the current working object.  : TRUE
9. private variable in a class starts with '_'(single underscore) : FALSE ( _ is for protected and __ for private.) 
10. "shallow copy" copies the references of objects : FALSE ( a new memory location will be created and the changes in one list wont reflect in the next related)
